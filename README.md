# Simple-Voice-Recorder

The task given to us was to build a simple voice recorder that records an audio, saves the recorded audio file and plays an audio file that is selected by the user. I did the LCD display and the menu along with the buttons to select the options. I have used a custom library for the LCD Display coded in the AVR platform. The LCD was used in the 4 bit mode.
